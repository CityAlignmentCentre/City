                City Wheel Alignment Centre has launched a new service to help local drivers cut their motoring costs and improve their safety on the roads. With our new Hunter alignment service we will be able to see in a matter of minutes the extent of any misalignment on customers’ cars. By correcting these errors we will return the car to the manufacturers’ original settings and ensure that tyre life and fuel economy are maximised but also the car geometry and handling. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Wheel alignment is all about the angle of the wheels in relation to the chassis. It keeps your car pointing in the right direction and driving straight. It also helps coordinate the tyres, lining them up accurately with the road surface, and spreads the weight of the car evenly. This gives you a smooth, balanced drive.
              You may experience problems when you drive over speedbumps too fast, hit a pothole or kerb or are involved in a minor accident. If you suspect that you have an issue with your wheel alignment, you need to book an appointment with us for inspection.

               <p>
                  Wheel alignment can be referred to as breaking or tracking and involves the correcting of the angles of your car’s wheels to ensure they are parallel to one another at a 90-degree angle to the ground.      
               </p>
              
               <p>The cause of mis-alignment can come from a variety of sources, bumping curbs, hitting potholes and worn parts from wear & tear are all contributary factors.
                Having a four wheel alignment check should be part of any responsible motorists servicing procedure. By having your vehicle checked annually or every 12,000 - 15,000 miles you can:
                <h3>Ensure <span class="text-warning">Safer Driving</span></h3>
      
               <p>Mis-alignment can affect handling and can make the car unsafe. A suspension system inspection is part of the alignment procedure; this will help highlight any worn or damaged parts before they cause a more costly problem.
               </p>
                Reduce <span class="text-warning">Fuel Consumption</span></h3>
               <p></p>Fuel consumption decreases as rolling resistance decreases. 
                A proper four wheel alignment along with correct tyre pressures minimises the rolling resistance.
               </p>       
               </p>

               <h3>Save Money span <sapan class="text-warning"> & the Environment</span></h3>
          
               <p>By preventing premature tyre wear (and early tyre disposal) improving fuel 
                  economy and minimising carbon emissions, it not only reduces the cost of motoring, but will help the environment too!
                </p>
                <h3>Prevent Excessive<sapan class="text-warning">Tyre Wear</span></h3>
                      
                <p>Mis-alignment is a major cause of unnecessary tyre wear. It is not always possible to actually see if a vehicle is out of alignment and by the time you do see the wear its too late, the damage is done! A properly aligned car can add thousands of miles to tyre life.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>Improve <sapan class="text-warning">Handling</span></h3>
                      
                  Does your car pull to one side? Do you constantly have to move the steering wheel to keep your car travelling straight ahead? Many handling problems can be corrected by four wheel alignment. With all the system components aligned properly, road shock is more efficiently absorbed for a smoother ride. Enjoy that new car feel!

              <h1>Let's Inform You<span class="text-warning"> About Camber </span></h1>
            Camber is the angle which the vertical axis of the wheel makes with the vertical axis of the vehicle. This angle is very important for the cornering performance of the vehicles. Generally a Camber around 0.5-2 degrees is given on the vehicles. Depending upon wheel orientation, Camber can be of three types.
          </p> 
            <p>
              <span class="text-warning">  1. Positive Camber </span>
          </p>
        <p>
            The Camber would be called positive when the top of the wheels lean outwards. Positive Camber is generally used in off-road vehicles. This is because, it improves the steering response and decreases the steering efforts required for turning the vehicle. Positive Camber is also provided in load carrying vehicles. This is because the heavy load on these vehicles cause outward leaning wheels to straighten up, improving the vehicle stability.
          </p><p>
            
            <span class="text-warning">  2. Zero Camber </span></p>
          <p>
            The vehicle is said to have zero Camber when the wheels stand perfectly straight on the ground.
          </p><p>
              <span class="text-warning">  3. Negative Camber </span></p>
            
          </p><p>
            Negative Camber is encountered when the top of the wheels lean inwards. 
            Providing Negative Camber improves the cornering performance. 
            When the vehicle turns on a corner, it performs a circular motion. 
            Hence, it experiences equal and opposite centripetal & centrifugal forces.
             The centripetal force is experienced in the form of friction on tyres. 
             The centrifugal force experienced by the car tries to throw it away from the turning center. 
             This increases the normal reaction on the outer wheels. 
             Due to increase in normal reaction, the frictional force on the outer tyres also increase.
              This friction acts as centripetal force and tries to bend the outer tires inwards. 
              The tires get deformed due to bending and the contact area between the wheels and the
               ground decreases. This in turns decreases the frictional force between the outer 
               tires and the ground causing the vehicle to drift during cornering. Hence a negative 
               Camber is given to the vehicles. The negatively cambered wheels lean inwards.
                So during cornering when the frictional forces try to deform the outer wheels,
                 they just simply get flat on ground increasing the friction with road surface.

              <h1>What Is <span class="text-warning"> Caster? </span></h1>
              <p><i class="bi bi-dot"></i>
                The caster angle identifies the forward or backward slope of a line drawn through the upper and lower steering pivot points when viewed directly from the side of the vehicle. Caster is expressed in degrees and is measured by comparing a line running through the steering system's upper and lower pivot points (typically the upper and lower ball joints of an A-arm or wishbone suspension design, or the lower ball joint and the strut tower mount of a McPherson strut design) to a line drawn perpendicular to the ground. Caster is said to be positive if the line slopes towards the rear of the vehicle at the top, and negative if the line slopes towards the front.
              </p>
              <p><i class="bi bi-dot"></i>
                A very visual example of positive caster is a motorcycle's front steering forks. The forks point forward at the bottom and slope backward at the top. This rearward slope causes the front tire to remain stable when riding straight ahead and tilt towards the inside of the corner when turned.
              </p> 
              <p><i class="bi bi-dot"></i>
                Caster angle settings allow the vehicle manufacturer to balance steering effort, high speed stability and front end cornering effectiveness.
              </p>
              <p><i class="bi bi-dot"></i>
                Increasing the amount of positive caster will increase steering effort and straight line tracking, as well as improve high speed stability and cornering effectiveness. Positive caster also increases tire lean when cornering (almost like having more negative camber) as the steering angle is increased.
      </p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-dot"></i>
        What's the downside to positive caster? If the vehicle doesn't have power steering, a noticeable increase in steering effort will be felt as positive caster is increased. Other than that, the effects of positive caster are pretty much "positive," especially increasing the lean of the tire when the vehicle is cornering while returning it to a more upright position when driving straight ahead.
</p>


<h3><i class="bi bi-dot text-warning"></i>Positive Caster</h3>
                           <p>
                            If the line slopes towards the rear of the vehicle, then you have positive caster. The down side to positive caster is if the vehicle does not have power steering. In this case steering effort will be increased. Positive caster is primarily beneficial to the vehicle as it increases the lean of the tire when the vehicle is cornering, while returning it to an upright position when driving straight ahead.
</p>

                <p><h3><i class="bi bi-dot text-warning"></i>Neutral Caster</h3></p>
                    <p>
                      Neutral caster is when the upright mounting points are on the same vertical plane as each other as well as being on the same vertical plane as the centre line of the hub and wheel.

                          Ensuring that your car has the correct wheel alignment has a range of benefits to both the driver and the vehicle, such as improving fuel efficiency, tyre life, road handling experience, and more importantly, increase driver and passenger safety.
                        
                        </p>
                      <p>
                          The HawkEye Elite system uses QuickGrip™ adapters, which enabls the sensors to grip the tyre not the wheel due to their spring-loaded arms. This saves any metal on metal contact and so avoids any potential damage to your cars wheels. Furthermore, the Hunter HawkEye Elite System features a fully integrated alignment system, linking its four high-resolution cameras and wheel sensors to give the most advanced 3D modelling of wheel positions and most accurate alignment measurements. Equally, the Hunter HawkEye Elite has an award-winning CodeLink system which recalibrates the Steering Angle Sensor to ensure the Electronic Stability Control system functions properly, ensuring the safety features of your car’s stability are kept at their maximum.

                    For virtually all vehicles, it's necessary to get your wheels aligned periodically.
                       Most car experts recommend scheduling an alignment every other oil change, or approximately every 6,000 miles or two-three years or if there are signs that the alignment is off. Often, the wheel alignment is recommended when new tires are installed. The alignment should be done more often if your car has wider tires or if it's a sporty car.
                       From our experience, if you re-check the wheel alignment after a year or two of driving, usually it will be slightly off. 
                       If you hit a large bump, the alignment will most likely be off.</p>
                       <p>
                       Car makers typically don't include the wheel alignment in the vehicle's maintenance schedule, but advice checking it if you find a tire is worn unevenly.
                       It's important to note that there are specific circumstances that may cause your vehicle to require tire alignment on a more frequent basis. Vehicles with wider tires or performance-oriented cars usually need to have their wheels aligned more often. 
                    </p>
                      <p>
                        However, to ensure the optimal safety of your car, yourself and others around you, 
                        it is best to opt for a wheel alignment every time you go to change your oil of the vehicle.

                    <p> <h5>1.Your steering wheel is not centered</h5>
If you’re driving straight down a flat, level road, your steering wheel should be sitting close to perfectly straight. There’s usually a small amount of discrepancy allowed depending on the crown of the road, but overall the wheel should be sitting centered and straight, and your vehicle emblem in the center of the steering wheel should appear level to you. If the wheel is off center by more than a few degrees in either direction, it’s time to have an alignment performed. This will return your steering wheel to center, and may improve the overall drivability as well.</p>
                   
                    <p> <h5>2. Your vehicle pulls to one side or the other</h5>
                        Similar to the first point, vehicle pull is most easily noticed while driving straight down a level road. There is a common misconception that the vehicle should drive perfectly straight with your hands off the steering wheel. In a perfect world, this would be true, but in reality this isn’t the case because all roads have some degree of crowning which causes a slight pull to one side. Completely removing your hands from the steering wheel is also very dangerous. Instead, the vehicle should drive straight ahead with very little effort on the steering wheel. If your car pulls to one side or the other, it’s time to have your alignment checked and corrected, which usually corrects the vehicle pull and improves overall drivability.
                    </p>


                    <p> <h5> 3. You notice abnormal tire wear in certain spots</h5>
                        Tire wear patterns can provide a lot of useful information about the condition of a car. A qualified technician can use tire wear patterns to make educated guesses about tire pressures, suspension condition, and alignment problems. Wear on only the inside or outside edges of tires can indicate a problem with the camber adjustment. Feathering or scalloping of the tires often indicates a problem with the toe adjustment. Tire wear is most often noticed by a mechanic while performing a tire rotation or an inspection performed during a service. Proper alignment greatly increases the life of your tires, so if you have any abnormal tire wear patterns, you should have an alignment performed on your vehicle.
                    </p> 


                    <p><h5> 4. The handling feels loose when driving</h5>
                        If the steering in your car feels a little loose or unstable, one of the possible causes is poor wheel alignment. This can be felt as wandering across the road when driving, or the car may feel very loose and sloppy around corners. If you notice symptoms like this, you should have the alignment checked and corrected if necessary.
                    </p> 


                    <p> <h5> 5. Your steering wheel doesn’t return to center</h5>
                        After completing a turn, the steering wheel should naturally start to return to center on it’s own as you keep driving. Of course you need to keep your hands on the wheel to help it achieve this quicker and keep control of the car, but if your steering wheel doesn’t even attempt to move itself back to center, then it’s a good indication that your alignment is off. Have an alignment check done, and a full alignment performed if necessary.
