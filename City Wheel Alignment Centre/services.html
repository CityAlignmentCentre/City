                            When you’re regularly driving on bad roads and at some point realize that one wheel is no longer rolling evenly, it can be hard to know what exactly the rim damage causes were. 
                            There are a number of road conditions and, yes, driver mistakes that can result in rim damage, a problem that only becomes more likely with low quality, broken, and downright porous roads.

                          High impact damage can be repaired, however a lot more time will be needed to fix things such as holes or serious damage to the face of the wheel.
                           In case such as these not only is more welding required but a lot of work on reshaping and reforming the wheel.

                          Often with extreme damage there will be the need to straighten the wheel too.

                          <p> Powder coating is used by many car manufacturers and a wide range of other industries to achieve a high-quality finish that is more resistant to fading, corrosion and scratching.  We offer a full range of powder coating colours to fit with what you are looking for. Powder coating is made up of polymer resins and other ingredients that have been mixed, melted and cooled and then ground into a very fine powder. 
      
                              At City Wheel Alignment Centre we apply the powder coating to your wheels in three stages using a spray gun which electrostatically charges the powder,
                               making is stick magnetically to your alloy wheels. Powder coating gives a uniform coverage that is more resistant to corrosion and rusting.

                          <p> Diamond Cut Alloy Wheel/Polished Alloy Wheel finish is aptly named due to the Diamond tip used to cut the face of the wheel.<p>
                          <p>
                              First of all in the repair procedure is the wheel is primed and painted; we then probe the face of the wheel to map it out on the computer.</p>
      
                          <p> 
                              This mapping allows the lathe to cut away a very fine slither exposing the bare metal, thus producing a 2 toned effect.</p>
                          <p>
                              The wheel is then powder coated in lacquer and baked to a super hard finish. We can match any colour and can even invent colours if you so wish! This can be done during your Diamond Cut Alloy Wheel Repair.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              With the ability to run 180 wheels in rotation our service has never been better. Dedicated paint and lacquer rooms take the quality of our repairs to the next level. Our new inspection line allows us to check and double check the standard of repairs DURING the repair process. </p>

                          <p> We believe there are no limits when it comes to customising your brake callipers. We aim to push the boundaries of design to meet our clients’differing tastes to create a stunning bespoke look.
      
                              By cleaning and painting the visible part of the brake calliper, we not only embellish its appearance but also make the car safer after reconditioning the callipers.
                               We can customise callipers for all vehicle makes and models.
                              
                              From basic remanufacturing and a standard paint service to a high-end, customised refurb.  </p>
