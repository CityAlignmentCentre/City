            <p class="lead my-4">
                The materials of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric and wire, along with carbon black and other chemical compounds. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides traction while the body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air. Before rubber was developed, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Early rubber tires were solid (not pneumatic). Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, including cars, bicycles, motorcycles, buses, trucks, heavy equipment, and aircraft. Metal tires are still used on locomotives and railcars, and solid rubber (or other polymer) tires are still used in various non-automotive applications, such as some casters, carts, lawnmowers, and wheelbarrows.         </p>

                            <p>
                                Tyres have something called tread. The tread refers to your tyres’ability to have a strong grip on a wet road. If your tyre has good tread, it will be able to stop, accelerate and turn easily even on a road which does not have the perfect driving conditions.

With regular wear and tear, the tread of the tyres begins to wear out.This will compromise the ability of your tyres to grip the road,becoming a safety hazard for all those involved. When you go for regular servicing of your vehicle, your mechanic will be able to inform you when it is required to change your car’s tyres. Your tyres can look worn out due to constant wear and tear while driving,or even if your vehicle gets into an accident.

                                Countries like the UK where winters are less severe and are characteristically more cold and wet with a low likelihood of snow are ideally suited for all season tyres. Because they are designed to cope with less extreme climates, they are sometimes referred to as four season tyres as they can be used in spring, summer, autumn or winter.

All season tyres essentially combine elements of summer tyres and winter tyres to create a tyre that has benefits of both so that they can be used all-year round, giving drivers peace of mind whatever the weather throws at them. While all season car tyres are not likely to match the performance of specialist summer or winter tyres during these respective seasons, they provide a good all-round mix of strengths. </p>

                                Winter tyres have a higher natural rubber content which keeps them supple in the cold. The softer they are, the more the tyre is able to interlock with the road surface, improving grip and handling. Unlike summer tyres, which harden quickly in cold temperatures, winter tyres perform best in temperatures below +7 degrees C.
                              </p>
                            <p><i class="bi bi-dot"></i>
                                Winter tyres also have thousands of tiny grooves (known as sipes) in their tread blocks which are used to disperse water and prevent aquaplaning. These grooves bite into the snow, slush and ice, providing optimal grip with the road.
                            </p> 
                            <p><i class="bi bi-dot"></i>
                                They also have a deep tread pattern. This provides a cavity for snow. Strangely, nothing grips snow better than snow, and the compacted snow intensifies the grip effect, adding traction to push the vehicle forwards on snowy and icy roads.

                                Summer tyres provide better all-round performance in the warmer months. They have a relatively hard compound which softens in milder temperatures to be able to adapt to dry as well as wet roads.

                                Although summer tyres can handle most weather conditions, they’re not suitable for harsher, colder climates. They have a harder rubber compound with less natural rubber than winter tyres and this begins to harden and can become brittle below +7 degrees C. That said, they are designed to adapt to higher temperatures without getting soft. This means that summer tyres have lower friction and therefore are more fuel efficient.
                            </p>

                                Summer tyres tend to have a simple block-shaped tread pattern, providing a large footprint with the road. This ensures excellent handling and have a massive impact on the braking distance.

                            <p>
                                Tyres and wheels (and tubes in case of tubed tyres) each have certain imbalance which results to an imbalance in the assembly. Balancing is the process of applying balance weights at the lightest part of the assembly. Since the new tyre fitted on wheel will create different imbalance points in the assembly, balancing should be done when a new tyre is mounted on a wheel or is refitted after repairs. It’s important to address wheels that are not correctly balanced to ensure you receive the best ride comfort.
                                <p>
                                Incorrectly balanced wheels produce a vibration that is felt through the steering wheel when travelling above a certain speed that can cause considerable discomfort over time and possibly deterioration of mechanical components.In addition to that, imbalanced wheels can cause premature wearing of your tyres, suspension, steering components and further more.

                                    A tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS) is to warn you when at least one of your tyres is under- inflated.
                                     A sensor valve fitted to each wheel alerts low tyre pressures, changes in temperature and imbalances to the driver via a dashboard symbol. 
                                     This symbol resembles a horseshoe with an exclamation mark in the centre. 
                                     This allows any problems to be addressed straight away, which could help prevent unsafe driving conditions.
                                  </p>

                                    There are two different types of tire pressure monitoring systems available on the market.
                                     Generally speaking, their purpose is the same, but the way they operate is completely different.

                                    This system are the most common. This type uses sensors mounted onto the rims, inside the tire, to measure the inflation of each tire separately.
                                     When the air pressure in a tire drops below 25% from the recommended inflation level, 
                                     the sensor notifies the computer system of the vehicle and the low-pressure warning light on the dashboard turns on. 
                                     Direct TPMS systems consist of 5 main parts: the 4 sensors mounted onto the wheel of each tire (usually near the valve stems) and the indicator in the vehicle's computer system.
                                      Therefore, when it is time for the vehicle's maintenance, replacing a direct TMPS system will be a bit more costly.

                                Indirect TMPS systems work with the vehicle's Antilock Braking System. 
                                The ABS monitors the wheel speed and it helps out the indirect TPMS system as well. 
                                When the tire pressure drops in the tire, it will roll at a varied wheel speed, compared to the other tires. 
                                The computer system notices this and makes the low-pressure light come on.
                                The Indirect TPMS system does not need additional components to be mounted on the wheels as it works with the ABS monitor. 
                                As a result, when the system needs to be replaced, additional labor costs and parts will not need to be paid for.     </div>

                                We recommend a tyre to be repaired if it is a small puncture (less than 6mm in diameter) in the central ¾ of the tyre, anywhere else is deemed unsafe as it is too close to the sidewall.
                                Because, if the tyre is showing any sidewall damage or there is visible bead wire or the rubber is distorted and cracking then the tyre cannot be safely repaired and will need replacing.

                                    <p>Step 1- Remove the tyre from the wheel and have a tyre expert thoroughly inspect it both internally and externally. If any serious tyre damage is present, then the repair should not continue.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Step 2- Locate and mark the damage, taking out any foreign object still puncturing the tyre.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Step 3- Prepare the puncture channel from the tyre inside of the tyre using a 6mm carbide mill cutter.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Step 4- Repeat the process, now from the outside of the tyre inwards, ensuring once finished the channel feels resistance free on the mill cutter.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Step 5- Thoroughly clean an area 10mm to 20mm larger than the repair patch using a specific pre-buff cleaner and repair scraper. Make sure to remove all residues such mould releasing agents

                                    <p>Step 6- Hold the patch in position and mark its outline on the inner liner.

                                    <p>Step 7- Buff the inner liner to roughly 5mm beyond the marked area using an appropriate domed buffing rasp. Make sure that any raised ribs are left flat after buffing, leaving suede finish.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Step 8- Remove dust and extraneous material including wire particles, buffed rubber and fluffed cords.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Step 12- Roll the reverse of the patch using a corrugated tyre stitcher. Roll from the centre of the patch outwards to remove any air bubbles, making sure the entire patch has solid contact with the buffed inner liner.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Step 13- Seal the combination tyre repair patch and plug base and buffed area still exposed with an inner liner sealant.
